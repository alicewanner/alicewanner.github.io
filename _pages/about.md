About Me
---
I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Michigan, in the [Machine Learning for Data-Driven Decisions](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/) lab led by Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/). My research focuses on machine learning for healthcare applications, and I am currently working on multimodal models for diagnostic tasks. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Virginia in May 2025. Outside of research, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring local coffee shops.
