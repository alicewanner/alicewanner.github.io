About Me
---

In Fall 2025, I will begin my PhD at the University of Michigan, joining the [Machine Learning for Data-Driven Decisions](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/) lab led by Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/). My research interests lie in machine learning for healthcare applications. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Virginia in May 2025. Outside of research, I enjoy reading, hiking, and exploring local coffee shops.
