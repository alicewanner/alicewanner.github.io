I graduated from the University of Virginia with High Distinction, earning majors in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in German. As part of the CS Distinguished Majors Program, I completed and presented a senior thesis titled Modeling Vegetation Dynamics at the Arctic Treeline: The Impact of Reindeer Grazing.

During my time at UVA, I was fortunate to be involved in a range of research experiences. I studied animal grazing in the Arctic in the [Epstein Ecosystem Ecology Lab](https://epstein.evsc.virginia.edu/) and conducted cryptography research with Professor [Wei-Kai Lin](https://weikailin.github.io/). I also contributed to CS education research under Professors [Robbie Hott](https://cs.robbiehott.com/) and [Ray Pettit](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/raymond-pettit). I am deeply grateful to each of these mentors for their guidance and for sparking my passion for research.

Outside of research, I served as a teaching assistant for three CS courses at UVA: Introduction to Programming, Algorithms, and Theory of Computation. I was honored to receive the Louis T. Rader Undergraduate Teaching Award in recognition of my work supporting students.
